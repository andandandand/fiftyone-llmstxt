# FiftyOne's llms.txt 
llms.txt files (actually .mds) for the documentation at https://docs.voxel51.com/

- `llms.md` gives an overview of the fiftyone documentation
- `llms-full.md` gives detailed context

Both documents were generated with https://llmstxt.firecrawl.dev/ using their API key. Stored as markdown files for easy browsing. 

These files are meant to be used as query context for Github Copilot, Cursor, or other LLM-based coding assitants.
