# FiftyOne's llms.txt Files

These llms.txt files (in markdown format) are for the documentation at https://docs.voxel51.com/:

- `llms.md`: Provides an overview of the FiftyOne documentation
- `llms-full.md`: Provides detailed context

Both documents were generated using https://llmstxt.firecrawl.dev/ with their API key and are stored as markdown files for easy browsing. These files are designed to serve as query context for GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and other LLM-based coding assistants.
